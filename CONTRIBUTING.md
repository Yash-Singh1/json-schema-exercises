# Contributing Problems

To contribute a problem, follow these steps:

## 1. Add the problem to the README

Under the corresponding difficulty, create a new list item. The format should be as following:

```markdown
Problem <number>: <title> ([problem](./problems/<difficulty>/problem-<number>.md))
```

## 2. Create the problem markdown file

Following the [template](./problems/templatem.md), create a markdown file named `problem-<number>.md` inside the difficulty's directory.

## 3. Create the solution

Following the [template](./solutions/template/), create a directory named `problem-<number>` and insert files for the solution. You can create multiple solutions by adding multiple schemas for solutions.
