The solution is the type array.
The items are all type number.
Since there isn't any exactLength property in JSON Schema, we combine minLength and maxLength.
The uniqueItems property is a boolean that ensures that all the items are unique. By setting this to true, arrays like:

[ 4, 5, 8, 4, 8 ... ]

With repititions are not allowed.
