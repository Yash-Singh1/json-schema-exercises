# Problem 01 - Nested objects - Medium

This problem is about using the `properties` property in JSON Schemas.

## Problem

The challenge is to write a schema which successfully validates schemas that represent the latitude and longitude. An example would be:

```json
{
  "lat": -23,
  "long": 54.78
}
```

Assume that the latitude and longitude coordinates represent ones on Earth.
